# Banksy.github.io

A Banksy fullstack website is created in different languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Java and MySql, etc.

In this website I used server application called TomCat which is help me to connect with the database to manipulate with the database.

#RUN the website
First, we need to install TomCat from its original website and install it in your system.
After installing we need to also install Java not the latest one.

Now, we need to Start the server by opening the TomCat with the help of Window key and Start the server.

Thanks for watching my website : D
