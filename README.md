**Banksy - Financial Website**

A Banksy fullstack website is created in different languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Java and MySql, etc.

In this website I used server application called TomCat, which help user to connect with the database to manipulate with the datas.

**RUN the website**
First, we need to ``` install TomCat ``` from its original website and install it in your system.
After installing we need to also install ```Java``` not the latest one.

Now, we need to Start the server by opening the TomCat with the help of Window key and Start the server.

Thanks for watching my website : D
